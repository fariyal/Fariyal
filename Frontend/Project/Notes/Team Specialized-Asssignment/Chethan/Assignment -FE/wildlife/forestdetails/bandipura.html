    <h1>BANDIPURA</h1>
    <p>
      Bandipur National Park  established in 1974 as a tiger reserve under Project Tiger, is a national park located in the south Indian state of Karnataka.
      It was once a private hunting reserve for the Maharaja of the Kingdom of Mysore but has now been upgraded to Bandipur Tiger Reserve.[1] Bandipur is known for its wildlife and has many types of biomes, but dry deciduous forest is dominant.
   <p>
      The park spans an area of 874 square kilometers (337 sq mi), protecting several species of India's endangered wildlife.
      Together with the adjoining Nagarhole National Park (643 km2 (248 sq mi)), Mudumalai National Park (320 km2 (120 sq mi)) and Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (344 km2 (133 sq mi)), it is part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve totaling 2,183 km2 (843 sq mi)
      making it the largest protected area in southern India and largest habitate of wild elephants in south Asia.
