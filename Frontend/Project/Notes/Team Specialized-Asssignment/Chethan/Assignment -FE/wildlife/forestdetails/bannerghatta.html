    <h1>BANNERGHATTA  NATIONAL  PARK</h1>
    <section>
      Bannerghatta National Park, near Bangalore, Karnataka, was founded in 1970 and declared as a national park in 1974.[1] In 2002 a portion of the park, became a biological reserve, the Bannerghatta Biological Park. It is a popular tourist destination with a zoo, a pet corner, an animal rescue centre, a butterfly enclosure, an aquarium, a snake house and a safari park.[2] There are ancient temples in the park for worship and it is a destination for trekking and hiking. The Zoo Authority of Karnataka, the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore, and the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment (ATREE) are collaborating agencies.
       Within the national park area are six rural villages enclosed within three large enclosures for sheep and cattle farming.[3]
