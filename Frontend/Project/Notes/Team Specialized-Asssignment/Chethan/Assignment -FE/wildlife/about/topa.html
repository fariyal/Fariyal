  Wildlife Conservation is the practice of protecting wild plant and animal species and their habitats.
   The goal of wildlife conservation is to ensure that nature will be around for future generations to enjoy and also to recognize the importance of wildlife and wilderness for humans and other species alike.
    Many nations have government agencies and NGO's dedicated to wildlife conservation, which help to implement policies designed to protect wildlife.
    Numerous independent non-profit organizations also promote various wildlife conservation causes.</p>

    <p>
      According to the National Wildlife Federation, wildlife in the United States gets a majority of their funding through appropriations from the federal budget,
       annual federal and state grants, and financial efforts from programs such as the Conservation Reserve Program, Wetlands Reserve Program and Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program.[3][4] Furthermore,
        a substantial amount of funding comes from the state through the sale of hunting/fishing licenses, game tags, stamps,
       and excise taxes from the purchase of hunting equipment and ammunition, which collects around $200 million annually.</p></font>
