					<p>VV Puram is Bangalore's most famous Food Street and a complete must-do for anyone visiting or
					staying in Bangalore. Till you get there and try the food, you really don't know what you're missing.
					This guide attempts to cover almost each of the outlets starting from when one enters the street at
					Sajjan Rao Circle. Before that a few basic guidelines about this food street and what we suggest
					you keep in mind while planning this gastronomical adventure.</p>
					<p><img src="logo/icon-right-arrow.png"> To taste maximum number of dishes and make the most of this trail, do 
					it in a group of 8 or more people (who do not mind sharing food). There is 
					so much on offer that just a couple of bites of the top items at each joint 
					will fill you up to a point when the senses may crave but the stomach will 
					refuse to take in any more. No point eating one or two items and heading back,we say.</p>
					<p><img src="logo/icon-right-arrow.png"> VV Puram comes alive around 7:30-8:00 in the evening. While some of the 
					shops start serving from 5:30-6:00 PM onwards, all of them are ready only by 7:00 PM.</p>
					<p><img src="logo/icon-right-arrow.png"> Weekends are extremely crowded so get there a little early. The crowds can 
					mean having to wait a fair bit of time at some of the shops.</p>
					<p><img src="logo/icon-right-arrow.png"> Finding parking is not extremely easy on weekends-try one of the roads 
					leading into Sajjan Rao Circle if you can't find parking around the circle itself.</p>
					<p><img src="logo/icon-right-arrow.png"> Do use dustbins to dispose of the plates etc. Most shops will have dustbins 
					placed at prominent locations.</p>
					<p><img src="logo/icon-right-arrow.png"> Try and avoid wasting food.</p>
					<h3>Not-what-this-street-is-known-for but can-try shops because their food is good:</h3>
					<p><img src="logo/icon-bullet.png"> Mumbai Pao Bhaji, Dabeli, Tawa Pulao,</p>
					<p><img src="logo/icon-bullet.png"> Punjabi chaats (pani puri, papdi chaat, bread pakora, cutlets)</p>
					<p><img src="logo/icon-bullet.png"> Paranthas / Rajasthani roti sabzi,</p>
					<p><img src="logo/icon-bullet.png"> Lassi / Rose Milk / Kulfi</p>
					<p><img src="logo/icon-bullet.png"> Chinese</p>
					<p><img src="logo/icon-bullet.png"> Sandwiches</p>
				</div><!--col2-->

				<div class="col3">
					<p>Now a quick overview of the food before we get into the specifics of what each of the joints serve.
					There are about 15 outlets serving different types of food (listed below outlet by outlet). We would
					classify the food varieties into the following categories in decreasing order of specialty-from musthave
					to do-try to not-what-this-is-known-for. That is not to say that food listed in the last category is
					not good-it's just not what this street is known for. Also, some of those in the last category are
					relatively new additions to this otherwise old food street, and purists that we are, we would like to
					call them out.</p>

					<p>Koramangala is another of Bangalore's hip and happening party and food districts, housing
					restaurants specializing in any cuisine you can think of. It is 4 kms from Royal Orchid down a
					straight road-the intermediate ring road. Koramangala has super interesting street-side joints,
					standing shoulder to shoulder with their more sophisticated, up-market cousins. An interesting
					Rajasthani place, a hole-in-the-wall Tibetian joint, Bhajji Carts, Pao Bhaji vans … lots to explore in
					this part of the city.</p>
					<p>(Quick advice on the traffic scene. Getting from Royal Orchid to Koramangala can take anywhere
					from 7 mins to 45 mins-it is a simple function of the time of day and traffic scenario. During office
					hours (read 8:30 AM-10:30 AM and 5:30 PM-7:30 PM) the 45 min time frame is what you
					should budget for.)</p>
					<p>It's worth splitting Koramangala into two sections. The area around Jyoti Nivas College has a
					buzzing student vibe. Then there is 80 ft Rd Koramangala that has what could be called the
					Koramangala Food Street for the string of street-side food stalls it hosts. (Koramangala actually
					had a food street (read about it here) which was relocated by the Municipal authorities a few
					months ago. There is hope that the authorities will allow the vendors to come back and set up the
					street the way it was but for now all the vendors have relocated from there.)</p>
