<h2>Bicycle Commuting </h2>




<p1>
Is the daily commute wearing you down? Through-the-roof gas prices; traffic jams; non-existent parking; lovely mornings and afternoons wasted inside your vehicle—what's there to do? Commute by bike! It's fun, it's fast, it's easy, it saves money, reduces global warming, and keeps you healthy and happy, too! Even with ample motivation, however, the idea of pedaling to work can seem daunting. With traffic, the ubiquitous , bad roads and weather, there's plenty to worry about. Which is exactly why we put together this guide chock full of our best bicycle commuting tips and tricks.<br> 

												Your Bike<br> 
The great thing about bicycle commuting is that just about anyone can do it and on just about any bike, too. Use your mountain bike? You betcha! Road bike? You’ll be at work in no time! Hybrid? Oh yeah, ride in comfort and style! Tandem? Double your fun and invite a co-worker!<br> 

Commuting by bike doesn’t have to be a major production. Feel free to make it as easy as possible. Try riding in a day or two a week and add days or maybe longer routes as you become more confident and get in better shape. Once you've commuted a few times, you’ll probably be amazed how much easier it is than you thought. And, after just a couple of weeks of riding, you'll be even more amazed at how good it makes you feel at work and outside of work, too. It’s awesome!<br> 

A fantastic way to enjoy your bike commuting is to invite a co-worker along. Nothing beats the buddy system for boosting motivation and fun.<br> 
  
												Tips and Tricks!<br> 
Baby wipes aren’t just for kids. If your office doesn’t have a shower, or when you don't have time to take one, having some baby wipes handy can save the day. Keep a supply in your desk or restroom and you'll always have a quick and easy way to freshen up.<br> 
Try ping-ponging. If your commute is too long to tackle at once, try this: drive in one morning, bike home that afternoon, and then pedal in the next morning. This is a great way to get used to bicycle commuting without riding too <br> much too soon.<br> 
But what if it's raining? No problem. Pick up a set of fenders for your bike and they'll keep you and your machine clean should you get stuck in the wet stuff.<br> 
Another way to keep safe is with front and rear lights. In most areas it's the law to ride with lights at night, but it's also a good idea to ride with them at dusk and dawn. Being visible to motorists drastically enhances your safety<br> 

                                          Mapping Your Route<br> 
When commuting by bike, the shortest distance to work may not be the safest or most enjoyable. And, you’re probably not going to take the same route that you drive. So, planning your route in advance is essential. <br> 

Take the time to drive your proposed biking route one day before work and then pre-ride it on the weekend to check how long it takes. If you’re having trouble finding a safe, fun route be sure to come in and ask us about our favorite routes and we'll point you in the right direction!<br>
