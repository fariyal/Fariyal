<h1> we're Service Pro's</h1>

<p1 >
Our service staff is professionally trained to work on all bicycle models, not just the ones we sell. So, whether it’s a minor tune-up or a major overhaul where we go completely through your bicycle and get it running like new, you can count on us to do the job right the first time, every time.<br>

									Walk-ins are welcome<br>
Getting ready for a ride and discovered that a tire's gone flat? Did you hit a pothole and knock your wheel out of true? Sometimes you can't plan when your bike needs attention. <br>

									Why not bring it in?<br>
If we can fix it on the spot, we will. And if we need more time, we'll let you know when to stop by to pick it up. Come in, call or email us soon so we can make that important repair or adjustment and get you back on your bike ASAP.
									
									Appointments are helpful<br>
If you prefer the convenience of an appointment, we'll let you know how long the repair will take so that you can plan accordingly. If it’ll be ready quickly, you might want to check out what's new in our store while you’re waiting.
If you’re going to run some errands while your bike's being fixed, just give us a number where we can reach you in case we have any questions.<br>
 												Thank you!<br>
