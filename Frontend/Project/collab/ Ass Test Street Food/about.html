<h1>About</h1>
<p1 style="font-style: oblique; font-size: 15px; ">
Streets are the lifeline of a city – like veins running across leaves, they criss-cross a city giving it
shape and character. The life and stories on its streets are a password to the character of a city ...
its essence, culture, history, architecture, food and its issues. The best way to get to know a city is
to walk around its lanes and by-lanes and explore its streets. BLR Street is an attempt to capture
the life and times of the streets of cities across the world, starting with India.<br>
Local food, especially street food and popular local eateries are perhaps the best gastronomical
introduction to a city – its ingredients, flavours and spices are the easiest way to get under the skin
or umm ... into the stomach of a city. However, discovering the best local places to eat in a city is
best done with a foodie friend who knows the small nooks and joints that serve exceptionally good
food. That is the inspiration behind BLR Street. To be that local foodie friend who helps travelers
find the best of local and street food, the joints where food and conversation flow and the cultural
nuances of the city come the fore.
The joints we cover include the hole-in-the-wall local eateries that are difficult to spot, famous
street food vendors and small, cozy cafes that serve as a perfect meeting spot for adda sessions,
quick bites, refreshing chai, addictive coffee and superb snack food.
The best local eateries in each city is what Talking Street will talk to you about, peppered with
posts about the vendors, stall-owners, peddlers and pavement dwellers. Happy listening!
