<h2>Let's Avoid These Signs</h2>

<h1>Speak Up For Cycling - Every Voice Counts</h1>



<p1 >Anyone who enjoys riding a bike should participate at least a little, in creating more and better places to ride. One of the wonderful things about living with your passion is the impact that an individual can have on the decisions that government makes about roads, bike paths and facilities. You can exercise the impact that you have to the benefit of all the cyclists in your community.

Stay Single!
Riding sweet single-track is one of the best experiences you can have. Yet, inexperienced and careless riders put these magic trails at risk, widening them and creating detours around obstacles that better cyclists ride right over. These practices ruin the ecology next to the original trail and encourage others to ride wrong. Ironically, it may also mean that you never master basic technical skills, which limits your progress as a cyclist.

The worst thing about careless single-track riding, though, is that it often results in confrontations with land-management groups, which may lead to rules banning off-road cycling.

Most of us would rather ride single-track than double track and fire road. And we don't want trail restrictions. 
Here are someideas to keep awake during ride  in pristine condition.<br>

1.	RIDE ON OPEN TRAILS ONLY. 

Respect trail and road closures (ask if not sure), avoid possible trespass on private land, obtain permits or other authorization as may be required. Federal and state Wilderness areas are closed to cycling. The way you ride will influence trail management decisions and policies.<br>

2. LEAVE NO TRACE. 

Be sensitive to the dirt beneath you. Even on open (legal) trails, you should not ride under conditions where you will leave evidence of your passing, such as on certain soils after a rain. Recognize different types of soils and trail construction; practice low-impact cycling. This also means staying on existing trails and not creating new ones. Don't cut switchbacks. Be sure to pack out at least as much as you pack in.<br>

3. CONTROL YOUR BICYCLE! 

Inattention for even a second can cause problems. Obey all bicycle speed regulations and recommendations.<br>

4. ALWAYS YIELD TRAIL. 

Make known your approach well in advance. A friendly greeting or bell is considerate and works well; don't startle others. Show your respect when passing by slowing to a walking pace or even stopping. Anticipate other trail users around corners or in blind spots.<br>


5. PLAN AHEAD. 

Know your equipment, your ability, and the area in which you are riding -- and prepare accordingly. Be self-sufficient at all times, keep your equipment in good repair, and carry necessary supplies for changes in weather or other conditions. A well-executed trip is a satisfaction to you and not a burden or offense to others. Always wear a helmet and appropriate safety gear.<br>

6. LEARN FROM OTHERS
If you're not sure how to ride a particular challenge, get advice from more experienced riders. Additionally following better riders will teach you to find and ride a better, more central line. No one to ride with? Consider riding the singletrack later in the day. This will give more experienced riders the opportunity to make a path through snow or autumn leaves, which you can follow.<br>

7. NEVER SPOOK ANIMALS. 

All animals are startled by an unannounced approach, a sudden movement, or a loud noise. This can be dangerous for you, others, and the animals. Give animals extra room and time to adjust to you. When passing horses use special care and follow directions from the horseback riders (ask if <br>
uncertain). Running cattle and disturbing wildlife is a serious offense. Leave gates as you found them, or as marked.<br>

KEEP TRAILS OPEN BY SETTING A GOOD EXAMPLE OF ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND AND SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE   OFF-ROAD CYCLING.
