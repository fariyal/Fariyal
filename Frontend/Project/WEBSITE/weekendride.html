<h1>WEEKEND RIDE</h1>
<p1 style="font-style: oblique; font-size: 30px;">We started doing guided bike rides as weekend ride  in 2013 and quickly became the most active rides of Mysuru. In 2013, we added City Ride bike rentals. We bring an incredibly high service ethic, enthusiasm, and local knowledge to bike rentals. We want you to fall in love with our city the easy way–on two wheels. We chose classy, comfortable bikes to help you blend in and make you feel like a local. We have simple, honest pricing. We'll take time to go over our custom map with you so you know the best bike routes around the city.<br>
Golden Gate Park?Mission murals?Victorian architecture? Cool cafés? Unique eateries?The Golden Gate Bridge? Yep, we can show you how to get there, and so much more.<br>
Hope to see you soon.<br>
for updated listings of all types of cycling events in and around our area. Rides require, at minimum, an appropriate bike in good working order, water, and a helmet. We suggest a spare tube, energy food, maybe a little cash in case we stop, and your biggest smile! Many rides are held subject to weather. It's a good idea to confirm dates, time and any specific requirements, too. We'll see you out there — and have fun!<br>
We believe bicycling is a healthy, affordable, and environmentally friendly form of transportation and recreation that should be safe and attractive to everyone who wants to ride, wherever their destination and whatever their purpose. Bicycling is good for our communities and for the people who ride, and so we work to increase the number of people who ride bikes as a regular part of their lives.<br>
The San Diego County Bicycle Coalition advocates for and protects the rights of all people who ride bicycles. We promote bicycling as a mainstream, safe, and enjoyable form of transportation and recreation.<br>
Since 1987, we have acted as voice for bicyclists in the region and have advocated for safer streets and hundreds of miles of bike paths, lanes and trails all across the San Diego region. We conduct educational programs, promote awareness of bicyclists and bicycling issues, review infrastructure improvements, and act as a voice for bicyclists to elected officials and decision makers all over San Diego County..</p1>
