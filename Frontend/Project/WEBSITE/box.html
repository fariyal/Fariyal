<h2>Box/Unbox A Bike</h2>

<p1 >How To Box<br>
	For driving trips, it’s easy to carry the bike on a vehicle rack. When you fly, however, you must box your bike to meet airline requirements and because it’s the best way to safeguard it. Once boxed, you can check the bicycle as luggage and take it with you so it arrives when you do. Whether you fly with your bike or ship it to your vacation destination, you’ll need to partially disassemble it and box it don’t forget the multitool. This takes about a couple on minutes.<br>

									Tips:<br>
•	Before removing the seat post, wrap a piece of tape around it right at the frame to mark your seat height so you’ll set things right during reassembly. If you have a quill-type stem (not thread less), mark its height, too.<br>
•	Don’t just label the box. Write the complete address on a piece of paper and attach it to your bike. That way, if they ruin your box, they’ll still know where to deliver the bike and who it belongs to.<br>
•	Be sure to cross out any old addresses or your bike might end up in the wrong place.<br>
•	To make the box extra tough, reinforce it by putting cardboard panels inside the box (next to your bike).<br>
•	Tape the box carefully to reinforce all the seams (don't forget the bottom).<br>
•	Don’t tape over the carrying holes because you want the shippers to have good handholds so they don’t get aggravated and abuse your bike.<br>
•	Keep in mind that there’s room in the box for other essentials, such as cycling clothing and gear. Plus, on the return trip, the box is a great place to pack dirty clothes.<br>
•	Don’t forget to pack the tools and materials needed to repack the bike for the return trip.<br>


How To Reassemble A Boxed Bike<br>
Everybody knows that the best vacations include cycling, which means bringing a bike along. And, the easiest way to do this is to have us box it so you can take it along during the journey. The only problem is that when you get to the sweet destination, your bike is in pieces inside a cardboard crate.<br>

To help, we offer these step-by-step instructions that make reassembly easy. It should only take about 30 minutes to go from opening the box to pedaling in that vacation paradise.<br>
   					
										Materials<br>
First, round up these few basic assembly tools and put them in a suitcase you plan to check:
5 and 6mm Allen wrenches/Multitool (for tightening the bolts)
lube (for installing pedals and lubing the chain)
15mm open-end wrench (for installing the pedals)
packing tape (for resealing the box for the return trip)

HOW TO???<br>

You may use packing tape to seal bike boxes. Cut the tape with a knife to open the box. Don't cut the box because you may slice your tires or frame. Once the box flaps are untaped, carefully fold them back and out of the way. When bike boxes are sealed at the factory, they're stapled shut with giant brass staples. Watch out for these because they can cut you and/or scratch your bike. To be safe, pull any staples out and throw them away. Now you can remove the bike and box contents, pulling out any loose items first. Work carefully to avoid banging parts against the bike and scratching the <br>
