Are all Life Time Cycle activities based around Road Cycling?<br>
The majority of our outdoor group rides are road rides. However, we also schedule mountain bike rides, triathlon training sessions and other event-specific activities. Our indoor studios let us keep things going when outdoor riding is not an option. Many clubs also host one-day cycling festivals and educational sessions featuring training techniques, basic bike maintenance and mechanics, guest speakers, bike demo days and other activities to help you get more out of cycling.<br>

Are there scheduled rides for my local Life Time Cycle program?<br>
Yes, each local Cycle Club has its own schedule of group rides on a weekly basis. Ride schedules are adjusted seasonally to account for weather conditions and different levels of fitness and condition at different points in the year. During some times of the year, this may even include Indoor Studio rides as well. This schedule is available on both your local Life Time Cycle webpage and in your club on the Club communication board.<br>

What should I expect or need to know about my first ride with the Life Time Cycle?<br>
Rides typically leave ON TIME. The posted ride time indicates the actual roll-out time, the time that the ride leaves. If you need 15 or 30 minutes to prepare and get ready to roll, please plan accordingly<br>.

Your local Club Coordinator would love to hear from you in advance! He or she is there to make sure you have a great experience from day one. He or she should offer to meet you before the ride, talk to you about the route and introduce you to some of the other riders.<br>

Sign a waiver â€“ You must have a signed waiver in order to participate. You should have completed this as part of the sign-up process. If you have any doubt, speak to your Club Coordinator.<br>

Arrive with your bike in good working order. Club members and Coordinators can help in a pinch, but 10 minutes prior to your first ride is not the time to be tuning up your bike. Visit your local shop or speak with your Club Coordinator in advance if you have any concerns about the condition or appropriateness of your bike.<br>

What gear do I need in order to participate?<br>
